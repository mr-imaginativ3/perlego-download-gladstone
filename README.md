This is a guide on how to use Mr GladstoneXD's script

After a few days of playing with the script (not coding, as is) I figured out how to use it.

I will share my process in a video shortly.

What I have/needed to make this work is the following

#1 Windows 11 Pro

#2 Obviously GlastoneXD's script (https://github.com/GladistonXD/perlego-download/)

#3 Perlogo working account (paid for)

#4 Chrome (not Brave, does mean that it does not work on Brave... just that all my success has been on Chrome)
I have not tested it on Brave. (Aint broke so not going to try to fix it)

#5 AutoScroll https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/autoscroll/occjjkgifpmdgodlplnacmkejpdionan

#6 Mini Mouse Macro https://sourceforge.net/projects/minimousemacro/

For those who are clever enough you probably already know what I am doing to make it work hands free.

For those who need a little help I will give you some clues and tips.

For the newbies a video is coming.

Tip #1 ePUB (auto) as it says is all automatic... nothing to do but click on the button and wait.

Tip #2 For PDF (Manual) When you use the autoscroll you must give the page the chance to load 2 or 3 pages or else the script will stop working (I don't know why).
When you scroll too fast you will see that only 2 or 3 pages are loaded at a time. Only when you stop scrolling does it coninue loading pages without stoping the script.

Tip #3 When you set up the autoscroll and the Mini Mouse Macro you must make the Macro (looped) a short scroll down (a few pages) then scroll back up till the mouse is over the the AutoScroll button. This will stop the scrolling from moving. Count for three mississipi or so then stop the recording of the macro.

Tip #4 The Autoscroll works by moving your mouse below where you started the autoscroll (where a button appears on the screen). The more the mouse is below the button the faster it scrolls.

Tip #5 Don't let more then two pages scroll before stopping the scrolling.

Tip #6 Set up shortcuts for record and stop. Test to make sure they work. Try stoping the Macro with your mouse when the Macro is running.... LOL

Tip #7 Record the movement starting at the AutoScroll button moving down then back over the button waitng 3 seconds before stopping the recording.

Tip #8 I would watch a whole book go through to make sure #1 you paused long enough and #2 you didn't scroll down too much. Either one will stop the script.

Tip #9 If the script page count stopped you have to start over.

Screen recording of my process and set up coming soon.

Any questions will be answered by updating this guide or the video. If I didn't answer it is because #1 your technical level is too low and I don't have time to answer #2 the question is already answered in the RAEDME or video. Have another careful look.
